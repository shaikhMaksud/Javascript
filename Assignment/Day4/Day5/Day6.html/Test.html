    <!-- question 1 -->
    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
    animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with
    a few lines of JavaScript code.)

    <!-- questin 2 -->
    Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then
    store that name in a variable called name.
    Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1:
    " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".
    Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to
    detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.
    And much more!

    output shows in console Browser html page.

    <!-- question 4 -->
    It separates HTML and code.
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.

    <!-- question 5 -->
    variable
    var x=10;
    const x=30;
    let x=20;
    let name=('Maksud');


    Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. In C, there are different types of
    variables (defined with different keywords), for example: int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals,
    such as 123 or -123.

    <!-- question 6 -->
    The difference between let and var is in the scope of the variables they create: Variables declared by let are only
    available inside the block where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in
    which they're declared.

    <!-- question 7 -->
    Introduction to the Difference Between Var, Let, and Const
    Here if we will declare a var variable or let variable, then it can be updated, but if we declare a const variable,
    it will not be updated in any case and will work fine with our function.

    <!-- questin 8 -->
    In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings,
    numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store
    a single type of data.

    <!-- question 9 -->
    JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions,
    variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

    <!-- question 10 -->
    What is ES6? ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th
    version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.
